title: Get an ORCID account?
---

I think I’ve had an [ORCID](https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/) account for more than five years but I’m just started to get a hang of all the different things it can simplify. I’m finding one of the most useful features to be its use as a login across many websites used for journals for which I’m either submitting to or reviewing for. In that sense, I guess it’s a lot like the use of Google or Apple accounts as a login across many services. More recently I was able to link my [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) submissions to my ORCID account. I hope in the long run the process of linking publications and datasets will make a lot of CV-related stuff easier. I look forward to seeing what new use cases might arise for ORCID!
