# Chapter 1: Continuous variation
#### Problem 2
The following table shows the number of sternopleural bristles in 50 individuals of *Drosophila melanogaster*.  

| | | | | | | | | | |
|24|24|21|21|21|20|19|19|18|24|
|23|25|22|24|22|22|18|20|22|28|
|23|27|23|20|23|21|26|27|27|28|
|26|26|24|26|27|26|20|22|21|18|
|18|21|17|21|18|20|23|22|34|22|

Knowing that the genetic variance of the trait is *V<sub>G</sub>* = 4, deduce the value of the environmental variance (*V<sub>E</sub>*) and the phenotypic (*CV<sub>P</sub>*) and genotypic (*CV<sub>G</sub>*) coefficients of variation. A good place to start here is creating an array of the phenotypes for bristle number:

```
b <- c(24,24,21,21,21,20,19,19,18,24,23,25,22,24,22,22,18,20,22,28,23,27,23,20,23,21,26,27,27,28,26,26,24,26,27,26,20,22,21,18,18,21,17,21,18,20,23,22,34,22)
str(b)
num [1:50] 24 24 21 21 21 20 19 19 18 24 ...
```
The solution to this problem requires solving for a few variables from equation (1.2), *V<sub>P</sub>* = *V<sub>G</sub>* + *V<sub>E</sub>*. Let's start by getting the mean of the bristle phenotype:

```
mb <- mean(b)
print(mb)
[1] 22.68
```
We also need to estimate the phenotypic variance:

```
vb <- var(b)
print(vb)
[1] 11.3649
```

Great! Now we can easily get our *V<sub>E</sub>* value since it's just the result of subtracting *V<sub>G</sub>* from *V<sub>P</sub>*, or:

```
ve <- vb - 4
print(ve)
[1] 7.364898
```

Getting (*CV<sub>P</sub>*) is similarly easy since we now have *V<sub>P</sub>* and the mean phenotypic value. Specifically, we see in the text on page 12 that *CV<sup>2</sup><sub>P</sub>* = $(\frac{V_P}{\bar{P}^2})$. Solving for *CV<sub>P</sub>* we have:

```
cvp <- (sqrt(vb))/mb
print(cvp)
[1] 0.1486414
```

Finally, and similar to *CV<sub>P</sub>*, we can estimate *CV<sub>G</sub>* as:

```
cvg <- (sqrt(4))/mb
print(cvg)
[1] 0.08818342
```
All done with chapter 1!
