# Caballero QG Chp. 2, Problem set Q1.b (R)
#### (b) Is the population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for that locus?

In order to test if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) we need to determine the observed vs. expected distribution of the different genotypes given the observed allele frequencies. Above we estimated the frequences of *A*<sub>1</sub>,*A*<sub>2</sub>,*A*<sub>3</sub>. Let's recall our allele frequencies for *A*<sub>1</sub> = p<sup>1</sup>, *A*<sub>2</sub> = p<sup>2</sup>, and *A*<sub>3</sub> = p<sup>3</sup>.

```
print(p1)
[1] 0.3375
print(p2)
[1] 0.45
print(p3)
[1] 0.2125
```
Now, let's work out the expected frequencies of each of expected genotype:

*A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>1</sub> = g1

```
g1 <- p1*p1*200
print(g1)
[1] 22.78125
```
*A*<sub>2</sub>*A*<sub>2</sub> = g2

```
g2 <- p2*p2*200
print(g2)
[1] 40.5
```
*A*<sub>3</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> = g3

```
g3 <- p3*p3*200
3
print(g3)
[1] 9.03125
```
*A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>2</sub> = g4

```
g4 <- 2*p1*p2*200
print(g4)
[1] 60.75
```
*A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> = g5

```
g5 <- 2*p1*p3*200
print(g5)
[1] 28.6875
```
*A*<sub>2</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> = g6

```
g6 <- 2*p2*p3*200
print(g6)
[1] 38.25
```
Now let's summarize the observed vs. expectated genotype counts:

| Genotype | *A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>1</sub> | *A*<sub>2</sub>*A*<sub>2</sub> | *A*<sub>3</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> | *A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>2</sub> | *A*<sub>1</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> | *A*<sub>2</sub>*A*<sub>3</sub> | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observed | 23 | 61 | 28 | 39 | 41 | 8 | 200 |
| Expected | 22.78 | 60.75 | 28.69 | 40.5 | 38.25 | 9.03 | - |

The observed vs. expected look pretty close! However, we need to use a significance test to decide how consistent these observations are with the expected values. We will use a $\chi$<sup>2</sup>-test, with the basic form of:

$\chi$<sup>2</sup> = $\sum$ $\frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}$

Let's create a variable for each of the expected genotype classes; we'll create a *e* equivalent for all *g* values above:

```
e1 <- 23; e2 <- 39; e3 <- 8; e4 <- 61; e5 <- 28; e6 <- 41;
```
Now let's generate our observed $\chi$<sup>2</sup> value, *c*

```
c <- ((g1-e1)^2/e1) + ((g2-e2)^2/e2) + ((g3-e3)^2/e3) + ((g4-e4)^2/e4) + ((g5-e5)^2/e5) + ((g6-e6)^2/e6)
```
```
print(c)
[1] 0.3950638
```
Our degrees of freedom for a HWE test is based upon the number of genotype classes (6) [minus the number of parameters needed to quantify our expected values](http://www.husdyr.kvl.dk/htm/kc/popgen/genetics/2/2.htm#:~:text=Now%20a%20Chi%2Dsquare%20test,to%20calculate%20the%20expected%20numbers.). We need 2 allele classes (the third is estimable from the first two) and the popoulation size (N). So we end up with 6-2-1 = 3df. There is a standard $\chi$<sup>2</sup>-test in R but it doesn't allow us to specify the degrees of freedom (df) (it's really setup for contingency tables). As found [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/422747/r-chi-square-test-with-degrees-of-freedom), we can use the function *pchisq* to make our test:

```
pchisq(c,df=3,lower.tail=FALSE)
0.9412603061593
```
Given our value is much greater than 0.05, we can accept our null hypothesis that the population is probably in HWE!
